## What is the status of Godot 4 Support?

An early-stage, experimental version of Godot 4 is ready [in this GitHub repo][repo]. It is not yet ready to build larger projects and will likely change significantly as it matures.

For an up-to-date overview of implementation status, consult [issue #24][features].


## What is GDExtension? Why don't we just upgrade GDNative?

The Godot team has officially announced [GDExtension](https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-gd-extensions) as the **replacement** for GDNative. GDNative is no longer supported in Godot 4.


## Where can I read more about it?

This book has a [dedicated chapter](../../gdextension), which is still under construction.
