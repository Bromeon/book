# Third-party projects

This chapter intends to provide an overview over the godot-rust ecosystem and list projects that use godot-rust across different domains.

godot-rust is a popular choice for game development, but this chapter is not limited to games. We also list other applications, as well as tooling and libraries that extend godot-rust and integrate it with other parts of the ecosystem.

While part of the book, this chapter is _not_ an official list of "featured" entries; project authors themselves are responsible for the up-to-dateness and accuracy of their description. 

Unless otherwise noted, projects are powered with Godot 3 and the GDNative-Rust binding.
