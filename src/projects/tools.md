# Projects: Tools and integrations

This page lists projects, which are intended to be used as an extension to godot-rust.  
Examples include:

* CLI or other tools enhancing the development workflow
* Libraries that directly enhance the godot-rust experience
* Libraries that connect godot-rust with other crates in the Rust ecosystem

This page should only provide a high-level description of each project (a couple sentences), plus relevant links and optionally one screenshot. It should _not_ include tutorials or code examples, as they tend to become outdated very quickly. Instead, the project's repository or homepage is a much better place for advertising the concrete functionality the tool offers and providing introductory examples.
