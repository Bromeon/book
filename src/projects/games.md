# Projects: Games

Below you see a non-exhaustive list of games that have been developed with godot-rust.

The page focuses on entries which are either in a playable state, or at least have some basic mechanics and graphics to show. For example, such an entry could be an indie game developed over many months, or also a polished game jam submission. The condition is that godot-rust is used for at least part of the game.
