# Introduction

Welcome to the `godot-rust` book! This is a work-in-progress user guide for the Rust bindings to GDNative.

If you're new to `godot-rust`, try the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) tutorial first!

If you have used earlier versions of `godot-rust` before, see [Migrating from godot-rust 0.8.x](./migrating-0-8.md) for a quick guided tour to the new API.
